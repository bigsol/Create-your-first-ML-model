Create your first ML model

<text>Consider the following sets of numbers. Can you see the relationship between them?</text>

<text>As you look at them, you might notice that the value of X is increasing by 1 as you read left to right and the corresponding value of Y is increasing by 3. You probably think that Y equals 3X plus or minus something. Then, you'd probably look at the 0 on X and see that Y is 1, and you'd come up with the relationship Y=3X+1.</text>

<text>That's almost exactly how you would use code to train a model to spot the patterns in the data!</text>

<text>Now, look at the code to do it.</text>

<text>How would you train a neural network to do the equivalent task? Using data! By feeding it with a set of X's and a set of Y's, it should be able to figure out the relationship between them.</text>
